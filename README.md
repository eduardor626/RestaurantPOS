# Restaurant Point Operating System

This is a program I wrote when I was learning Java and the Java Swing Library in 2018. I was working as a restaurant server at the time and decided to learn Java to create a quick UI similar to that of the restaurant I was working in.

### Login
Here is a simple Login Menu the user is prompted with at the beginning. If the user's ID number matches an employee ID number in the Employee file the employee's home screen is displayed.

### Employee Home Menu
When the employee's ID is verified their home screen window is displayed. They are presented with a variety of buttons to select. When pressing New Table they are prompted to enter their New Table number. The employee inputs their table number and the New Table's button will now appear on their home screen window.
