## Restaurant Point Operating System

This is a program I wrote during learning Java and Java Swing Library in 2018. I was working as a restaurant server at the time and decided to learn Java to create a quick UI similar to that of the restaurant I was working in.


Here is a simple Login Menu the user is prompted with at the beginning. If the user's ID number matches an employee ID number in the Employee file the user's home screen is displayed.

Login View            |  Login User
